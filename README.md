# <JavaScript Quizardry>

## Module Four Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to build a small quiz from the ground up, including the following features:

- On button click begin timer;
- Multiple choice format specified;
- Record user scores and write highest score(s) to local storage;
- Dynamic Javascript code leveraging the power of API's;
- When questions are answered incorrectly, 10 seconds are removed from the timer;
- Once all questions have been answered, or time expires, the quiz is finished;

Along with these required features, I also added: 

- Color change feature on timer when <= 20 seconds, and again when <= 10 seconds;
- Next button for increased consistency in question and option delivery;
- Background colors to indicate correct or incorrect responses on click;

## Credits

[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and, of course, [Google](https://www.google.com) always for syntax and inspiration.  New to the help Christopher succeed group this week are Bootstrap, Jquery, and all that sweet, sweet documentation.  Really, though, these API's are absolute game changers in a lot of respects and had I learned them to utilize from the beginning, this would have been a much less stressful situation. This was by far the most challenging challenge for me.  The sheer amount of code required to make this functional in the way that I understand how to make this functional really showed me the areas in which I need to improve.  Not to mention that I wanted the program to operate in a specific way, which was much more complex than necessary.  That said, I'm relatively happy with the finished product, though I will be updating this program once I can, as it could be done so much better, I'm just not quite there...yet!
